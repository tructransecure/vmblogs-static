Consequently, this tool can also help you diagnose and troubleshoot HDX issues. Its built-in expert system analyzes all captured data and identifies potential problems in state, configuration, and\/or performance. It can also suggest corrective action that can help resolve the problem or improve performance. For example, it detects when multimedia redirection is in use and if your endpoint device supports it. It also can tell you what audio codec you are using and its bitrate.<\/p>\n<p>Since the release of HDX Monitor 2.x, this tool has had the ability to diagnose XenApp and XenDesktop (VDI) sessions via the WMI diagnostics interface; both locally and remotely from any machine in the domain.
